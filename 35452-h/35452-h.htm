<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dear Friends of our youth, should you happen to look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the curious things in this curious book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should you, with quizzical countenance, ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The how and the why of our curious task&mdash;</span>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/i006b.jpg"><img src="images/i006b.jpg" alt="Gobolink"/></a></div>

<span class="i4">We could truly reply<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the query of "why&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the smile on your lip, and your questioning eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That the work was begun<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In a spirit of fun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To amuse when the work of the daylight was done;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And continued, because we believed it would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amusement to such as were weary as we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drift for awhile among goblins and elves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haply make shadows and rhymes for themselves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though years have passed since we drifted apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're all of us more or less children at heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maybe yourselves and the youngsters 't will please<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell for an hour with such creatures as these.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, some one has said, in a moment of spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cannot make pictures of what we've not seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such an assertion deserves only scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the shape of the Gobolink never was born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes like the marvelous mimes of our dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one has been supping on salads and creams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curious changes of vision take place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horse may appear with an elephant face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goat with a cane, and the goose with a hat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six legs on the dog, and two tails on the cat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We never can tell, though we're sorely perplexed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shape will be shown us, or what will come next;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these are the things that our Gobolinks do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear friends, and dear children, we give them to you.<br /></span>

<p style="clear:left">Drop a little ink on a sheet of white paper. Fold the sheet in the center and press the ink-spots
together with the fingers. All of the pictures in this book were made in this manner&mdash;&mdash;none
of them having been touched with a pen or brush.</p>

<p>A great deal of practice will only go to show that the Gobolink, as his name implies, is a
veritable goblin of the ink-bottle, and the way he eludes the artist's design proves him a self-made
eccentric creature of a superior imagination.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be expected that the animals and birds of prey referred to under more or less
familiar names in the accompanying rhymes will be strikingly correct as to anatomy; and because,
as upon page 15, the elephants, or whatever they may be, happen to have
each a row of interesting tails continuing along the full length of the spinal column,
no unkind criticism should be made upon the ability of the overworked and
conscientious artists, who would have made fewer tails if they could, and have
added nothing to the price of the book on account of undue liberality in the
matter of caudal appendages.</p>

<p>In fact the most unexpected and startling results will often occur&mdash;results
grotesquely and strangely beautiful, well worthy of preservation. The authors of
this book will be glad to receive a few examples of some of the more unusual
Gobolinks or Shadow-Pictures that may occur to those interested in the amusement.
They may be sent care of The Century Co.<!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_GAME_OF_GOBOLINK" id="THE_GAME_OF_GOBOLINK"></a>THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.</h2>


<div class="figleft"><a href="images/i010a.jpg"><img src="images/i010a.jpg" alt="Gobolink"/></a></div>

<p>Persons of all ages may obtain amusement out of Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures,
as they are also called.</p>

<p>The following is a very good method for playing the game:</p>

<p>Let three of the company be selected by the hostess as judges. To each
of the others she then distributes from five to ten sheets of paper, from which
they must produce at least one completed picture and rhyme in a given length
of time, say five minutes, at the end of which the hostess rings a bell and
the judges proceed at once to take up the pictures. These are then passed
upon by them while the hostess is distributing a fresh round of paper, and the
best two and the worst one are laid aside.</p>

<p>Those whose pictures have been selected now act as judges, surrendering
their places at the tables to their predecessors, and another lot of pictures and
rhymes are made.</p>

<p>The game is continued in this manner until the hostess
announces the arrival of the time for final judgment, or until a certain hour
specified in the beginning.</p>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/i010b.jpg"><img src="images/i010b.jpg" alt="Gobolink"/></a></div>

<p>The three judges then in office now select one of the company as "reader,"
and such person selected shall take up his position in strong light, and after
reading the verses on each picture shall display it in full view of all present.
It should then be pinned to a suspended sheet or screen where it may be
easily examined by the company.</p>

<p>This shall be continued until all the pictures selected by the judges have been so treated and
displayed. The reader then acts as chairman, and the company proceed to vote on them for first,
second, and booby prizes.<!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Gobolink receiving second largest number of votes for first prize is
awarded second. The ballot for booby should be, of course, taken separately.
Pictures should be signed or otherwise identified.</p>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/i011a.jpg"><img src="images/i011a.jpg" alt="Gobolink"/></a></div>

<p>Where a number are making the pictures, it is well to seat them around a
large table with the ink-supply in the center.</p>

<p>Jet-black ink should be used, and a good quality of unglazed paper. The ink
should not be too thin.</p>

<p>The table should be protected from accident with several thicknesses of newspaper.</p>

<p>A filled pen or tincture-dropper may be used for supplying the ink.</p>

<p>For a specially invited Gobolink party the company may dress in any grotesque fashion,
remembering only that both sides of their costume shall be the same, this being a feature peculiar
to Gobolink attire.</p>

<p>No game could be more productive of amusement than Gobolink.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
